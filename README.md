# TypeID

### A type-safe, K-sortable, globally unique identifier inspired by Stripe IDs

## What is it?
TypeIDs are a modern, type-safe extension of UUIDv7. Inspired by a similar use of prefixes
in Stripe's APIs.

TypeIDs are canonically encoded as lowercase strings consisting of three parts:
1. A type prefix (at most 63 characters in all lowercase ASCII [a-z])
2. An underscore '_' separator
3. A 128-bit UUIDv7 encoded as a 26-character string using a modified base32 encoding.

Here's an example of a TypeID of type `user`:

```
  user_2x4y6z8a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7j8k
  └──┘ └────────────────────────┘
  type    uuid suffix (base32)
```

A [formal specification](./spec) defines the encoding in more detail.

## Benefits
+ **Type-safe:** you can't accidentally use a `user` ID where a `post` ID is expected. When debugging, you can
  immediately understand what type of entity a TypeID refers to thanks to the type prefix.
+ **Compatible with UUIDs:** TypeIDs are a superset of UUIDs. They are based on the upcoming [UUIDv7 standard](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04.html#name-uuid-version-7). If you decode the TypeID and remove the type information, you get a valid UUIDv7.
+ **K-Sortable**: TypeIDs are K-sortable and can be used as the primary key in a database while ensuring good
  locality. Compare to entirely random global ids, like UUIDv4, that generally suffer from poor database locality.
+ **Thoughtful encoding**: the base32 encoding is URL safe, case-insensitive, avoids ambiguous characters, can be
  selected for copy-pasting by double-clicking, and is a more compact encoding than the traditional hex encoding used by UUIDs (26 characters vs 36 characters).

## Implementations
Implementations should adhere to the formal [specification](./spec).

## Command-line Tool
This repo includes a command-line tool for generating TypeIDs. To install it, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetpack.io/typeid | bash
```

To generate a new TypeID, run:

```console
$ typeid new prefix
prefix_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp41
```

To decode an existing TypeID into a UUID run:

```console
$ typeid decode prefix_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp41
type: prefix
uuid: 0188bac7-4afa-78aa-bc3b-bd1eef28d881
```

And to encode an existing UUID into a TypeID run:

```console
$ typeid encode prefix 0188bac7-4afa-78aa-bc3b-bd1eef28d881
prefix_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp41
```
